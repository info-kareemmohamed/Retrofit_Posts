# Retrofit_Posts
This application was created to train me on Retrofit and MVVM and RecyclerView and CallBack
App Name: [Posts]

App Description:
[Posts] is a simple application developed using modern techniques for Android app development. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and utilizes the Retrofit framework for API communication.

Key Features:

Retrofit Integration: The app utilizes Retrofit to make HTTP requests to the API and retrieve data asynchronously.

MVVM Architecture: [Posts] follows the MVVM architectural pattern, separating the application logic into three components: the Model, View, and ViewModel. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and promotes code reusability.

RecyclerView: The app incorporates the RecyclerView widget to efficiently display a list of items retrieved from the API. It provides a smooth scrolling experience and optimizes memory usage by recycling views.

Callbacks: [Posts] uses callbacks to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from the API and updating the UI accordingly. Callbacks allow for efficient handling of data responses and error scenarios.
